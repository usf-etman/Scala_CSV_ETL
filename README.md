# Scala_CSV_ETL
## Introduction
The aim of this project was to create an ETL tool that extracts data from CSV files, transform it and finally loads it into Postgres database.
The code accepts two arguments from the user which are:
- Path to the table directory with CSV files.
- Path to the excel file that's holding the metadata for that table.

I provided test data and metadata files with the project.
